This is a Java command line client to find the best move in a Scrabble (Words
With Friends) game.

The script requires two or more arguments:

1. A filepath, which will *always* be written to if it doesn't exist. If it 
   does exist, it will be assumed to be a Serializable copy of a Board class.

2. A command such as "print" or "find". This command is followed by command-
   specific arguments, run the Main class to find out more.
   
Examples:
 
# search for the highest-scoring valid word placement given your <letters>
$ java Main myGame find <letters>

# play a move as described by the arguments after the "play" command
$ java Main myGame play ...

# dump a list of raw words that can be formed with <letters>
$ java Main myGame words <letters>

# print the current state of board
$ java Main myGame print
